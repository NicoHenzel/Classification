Steps for Dataengineering (needed to generate Rapid Miner Studio Datasets in order to run processes):

1. Download datasets
Datasource: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-600k-tracks
artists.csv --> Artist Features like Popularity, Followers etc.
dict_artists.json --> The artists recommended for fans of artists. Each recommendation is sorted in descending order (The first one is the most favorite one). The number of recommendations are limited to 20.
tracks.csv --> The audio features of tracks.


https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jfreyberg/spotify-chart-data
charts.csv: This dataset is comprised of weekly Spotify track chart data from 2014 to 2022.
Used to get the chart position of the song in various countries.

Store them in Classification\Data\Raw

Use Table in Classification\Data\Other:
FinTable.csv

2. Run JsonReads.ipynb in python (adjust file paths if needed)

3. Import Datasets into RapidMinerStudio with these settings:
Header Row - 1
Start Row - 1
Column Separator - Comma ","
Encoding - UTF-8
Escape Character - \
Decimal Character - .
Use Quotes - "
Skip Comments - #


4. Run Processes in Engineering Folder in Rapid Miner 
ArtistsRecommendedBy Dataset generated by Rapid Miner Process "0. Generate Recommended Artists Dataset" from "artists.csv" and result of "JsonReads.ipynb"
Final Dataset Generated after running "1. Join Data" and "2. Step Data Engineering"
